# Artemis Mission Website

This is a personal web project exploring NASA's Artemis mission through a clean, interactive site. I designed the layout across multiple HTML pages, added animations and styling with CSS, and integrated simple JavaScript-based mini-games to make the experience more engaging.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structured the site across several pages including mission overview, engineering, crew, and games.
- **CSS**: Used variables, animations, and media queries to customize the design and ensure responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: Implemented navigation functionality and built three mini-games: a spaceship game, a memory match, and a moon customization tool.

## Mini-Games
- **Spaceship Game**: Navigate through space, avoid asteroids, and collect fuel.
- **Memory Game**: Match Artemis-themed image pairs.
- **Customize the Moon**: Draw freely using canvas.

The goal was to make the topic both informative and fun to explore. Feel free to explore or reuse parts of the project for your own learning.
